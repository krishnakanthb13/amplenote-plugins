# URL-Search-GUI Code Documentation

## Functional Overview

This code defines a JavaScript Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) that creates an object named `USG` with a method called `insertText.Hack`. This method empowers users to input search criteria for notes, tasks, and calendars within an application, likely a basic utility for everyone! This method constructs precise search queries and URLs, then performs actions such as opening a URL or creating a new note.

### Key Steps and Components

1. **Error Handling:**

    1. The code is encapsulated within a `try-catch` block to ensure any errors during execution are caught and handled gracefully.

1. **Fetching Notes:**

    1. It retrieves lists of notes that match specific criteria using `app.filterNotes()` for both `noteHandles` and `noteHandlesE`.

1. **User Prompt:**

    1. A prompt is presented to the user to collect various search criteria, including groups to include/exclude, tags to include/exclude, keywords, and specific notes to include/exclude.

    1. Action buttons in the prompt allow the user to either save the results to a new note or directly open a URL.

1. **Input Validation:**

    1. If the user cancels the prompt or fails to provide necessary input, appropriate alerts are displayed, and the function exits.

1. **Processing Inputs:**

    1. The collected inputs are processed and converted into arrays for easier manipulation.

    1. Tags, groups, and note references are split and trimmed to ensure clean data handling.

1. **Constructing URLs and Search Queries:**

    1. The base URL is determined based on the type of search (notes, tasks, or calendar).

    1. URL parameters are constructed by encoding the user inputs and concatenating them appropriately to form a complete URL.

    1. A search query string is also built using the same input parameters for use within the app.

1. **Finalizing Outputs:**

    1. The final search query and URL are formatted as clickable links.

    1. The current date and time are fetched to include in the final report for reference.

1. **Executing Actions:**

    1. Depending on the user's selected action, the function either creates a new note containing the search report, opens the constructed URL, or replaces the current selection with the report text.

    1. A final alert confirms the completion of the process, ensuring the user is informed of the successful execution.

### Summary

This code is designed to provide a robust solution for filtering and searching notes, tasks, or calendar entries based on user-defined criteria. It leverages asynchronous operations for data fetching and ensures a smooth user experience through comprehensive error handling and input validation. By constructing precise search queries and URLs, the code allows users to perform meaningful actions seamlessly within the application.
